# Hypertension (Heart Disease) Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease (hypertension) in individuals based on various health attributes like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, chest pain type, and other medical indicators. The goal is to use machine learning models to classify individuals as either having heart disease or not

## Project Overview

The project uses a dataset containing various attributes related to heart disease and applies machine learning algorithms to predict whether an individual has heart disease (target variable). We will preprocess the data, train different models, and evaluate the performance of these models.

### Attributes
- **age**: Age of the individual in years
- **sex**: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
- **cp**: Chest pain type (1-4)
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol level
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar (1 if > 120 mg/dl, else 0)
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2)
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise
- **slope**: Slope of peak exercise ST segment
- **ca**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
- **thal**: Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect)
- **target**: Whether the individual has heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). The data consists of several health-related attributes and a target variable indicating whether the individual has heart disease.
